/// `scaleEffect(_:anchor:)` resizes a `Circle` according to the specified scale factor and anchor point.
///
/// This modifier scales the size of the `Circle` view. The first parameter specifies the scale factor,
/// which determines how much larger or smaller the view should be compared to its original size.
/// The second parameter specifies the anchor point from which the scaling occurs, allowing you to control
/// the behavior of the scaling effect.
///
/// This method can be used within your SwiftUI views to dynamically adjust their size based on user interaction
/// or other state changes in the environment, just like built-in guides.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - scale: A value representing the scale factor. A scale of `1.0` means no scaling, values greater than `1.0` enlarge the view, and values less than `1.0` shrink the view.
///   - anchor: The point in the view from which to scale. By default, scaling occurs from the center of the view.
///
